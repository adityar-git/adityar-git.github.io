            In this effort, we visually analyse how different drugs can be
            clustered into various categories based on their chemical
            composition. We also check the effect of individual drugs in each
            cluster for the effect they produce on the Gene Expression. Further
            deep analysis and use of machine learning on this data could help us
            yield information on various phenotypic mapping of the drugs
            represented in LINCS L1000 data.

            Computational Drug Repositioning studies holds a promising future to
            predict new drug-phenotypes mapping of the drug with comparatively
            cheaper cost and lesser time. Additionally, With the NIH funded
            public data repository, LINCS transcriptomic data, which provides a
            comprehensive study for differential gene expression over 1.4
            million probes for 12,000 genes, we are not at the technologically
            advanced phase to predict the various effect of drugs at a
            micro-level. In repurposing studies, various features of drugs hold
            predominant importance, although the ranking of such features to
            predict a particular phenotype still remains hazy. In this study, we
            aim to visualize and analyse various drugs in the LINCS L1000
            dataset with their Chemical Fingerprints. <br /><br />
            Drug Bank approved drug could be present in either of the five
            classes:
            <b
              >Approved, Investigational, Neutraceutical, Illicit, Vet- Approved
              and Withdrawn
            </b>
            .A drug may be present only in one category or maybe in more than
            one category. A drug with more than one category - say approved and
            investigational - would mean a drug has been approved for certain
            conditions on certain patients while is still under the process of
            approval for some others. We checked the information corresponding
            to all drugs in LINCS. The number of drugs in each category is as
            shown in the barplot.
            <span style="color: #99000d; font-weight: bold;">Clicking</span> on
            the bar would give drugs corresponding to each category. We see more
            number of drugs in approved stage are taken in the experiment of
            LINCS.

            Most drugs in the study are patented from the US and Canadian region
            of the globe. It is estimated that for the drug to be approved after
            the clinical-stage, around 2 million dollars are invested. The US
            and Canada have invested from
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0072b0;">802 million</span>
            dollars in 2003 to around
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0072b0;">1.3 billion</span>
            dollars in 2013 for the clinical study. Also to note here is the
            fact that a drug once approved can also be reverted back to the
            withdrawn stage after post-marketing surveillance, which leads to
            the serious financial impact on industry and health impact on
            people.

            Many features of the drugs could be used to analyse the drugs and
            their mapping to various phenotypic conditions. One such vastly
            studied feature is Chemical structure of a drug. The 2D chemical
            structure of the drug is converted to MACCS chemical fingerprints,
            denoting the presence of 100 subunit in the chemical compound.
            Distance-level analysis of the chemical structure of the drug could
            tell us how closely the two drugs are related. For the hypothesis
            that similar drugs could be clustered together and may yield similar
            phenotype, we cluster 20,338 LINCS drug into cluster using
            hierarchical clustering.

            affected. <br /><br />
            The bar chart on the left also gives an idea of how the drug affects
            the genes and which gene is most up-regulated and down-regulated.
